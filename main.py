x = sum(my_list)
print(x)

### Q2: Write a Python program to get the largest number from the list.

print("Largest number is:", max(my_list))

my_list2 = [i for i in my_list if i%2 == 0 ]
print(my_list2)


### Q4: use list slicing to get a new list from the previous list starting from the start to the 5th element in the list.
